Description: The package implements a simple, robust and highly scalable approach to tackle 
    the compositional effects in differential abundance analysis. It fits linear regression models
    on the centered log2-ratio transformed data, identifies a bias term due to the transformation 
    and compositional effect, and corrects the bias using the mode of the regression coefficients.
    It could fit mixed-effect models.
